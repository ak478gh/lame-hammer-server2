In simple terms, it is a condition that causes excess acid production in the stomach. This not only causes discomfort in the stomach but also leads to other symptoms such as sour taste in the mouth, difficulty in swallowing, and indigestion. There are numerous causes of acidity right from poor eating habits and excessive stress to use of certain medications. Moreover, lifestyle factors such as smoking and consuming foods loaded with oil, fats, and spices can also up your risk of acidity. If you experience acidity once in a while it may not indicate any health issues. However, if you suffer from frequent bouts of acidity, where the symptoms occur at least two or more days per week, there might be some underlying disorder associated with it. It is advised to consult your doctor in such cases.You can fight acidity with simple lifestyle changes and effective home remedies such as tulsi, mint, fennel seeds, and cold milk. In most cases, over-the-counter medications to reduce/neutralise the acid are known to be of great help.",

Acne, or acne vulgaris, is a skin condition where the pores and hair follicles of the skin get clogged with sebum, which is an oily, wax textured substance secreted from the skin glands. Although the face is the most commonly affected part, acne can occur anywhere on the body like the chest, shoulders and upper back. Acne is mainly of two types, comedogenic and non-comedogenic. Comedogenic acne is mainly non-inflammatory and can be seen in the form of whiteheads and blackheads. Non-comedogenic acne, on the other hand, is inflammatory and may be red, pus-filled, and painful. The treatment of acne comprises topical, systemic, and lifestyle remedies. In topical remedies, your doctor will prescribe ointments or cleansers. Systemic therapy consists of either antibiotics or hormonal preparations to keep the acne at bay. Lifestyle changes for acne majorly include a clean diet, better hydration and regular exercise. Timely treatment of acne can be of great help in preventing acne scars in future.",

      "description": "Allergies are caused when the body’s immune system responds abnormally to an external trigger known as ‘allergen’. These allergens are present in our environment but do not usually incite an immune response in other people. While in some people, the body’s immune system generates antibodies against these foreign bodies or allergens. This causes inflammation and leads to various symptoms that can range from being mild to quite severe. The symptoms of allergy vary such as mild sneezing, runny nose, swelling of face, swelling of the tongue, skin rash, itching, and difficulty in breathing, etc. Anaphylaxis is a severe reaction to any type of allergy which can be life-threatening, if not promptly treated. Allergies are widely prevalent across the world. These can be caused due to different types of allergens such as dust, molds, mites, foods like nuts, fish, and medicines like penicillin. Clinical treatment for allergies is suggested with antihistamine medicines, steroids, and OTC preparations to provide relief from symptoms.",

It is characterized by disturbances in thinking skills, reasoning, language, and perception and, eventually, the ability to carry out simple daily tasks. The exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is not known. However, accumulation of amyloid proteins and tangled bundles of fibers called neurofibrillary, or tau tangles, in the brain are suspected to play a role. Alzheimer’s disease is not a normal part of aging and is not something that inevitably happens in later life. However, the likelihood of having Alzheimer's disease increases substantially with advancing age. A combination of age-related brain changes, genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors are thought to increase the risk of this condition. Though AD is not entirely preventable, ensuring an extensive social network, and frequent participation in social, physical, and intellectually stimulating activities like reading, playing games, participating in adult education courses, and other recreational activities can delay its onset. Current Alzheimer's medications can help temporarily with memory symptoms and other cognitive changes. Caregivers play an extremely pivotal role in helping the patient with their daily needs and activities as well as protecting them from any danger.",

Primary amenorrhoea is when a woman never had menstrual periods, and in secondary amenorrhoea, there is the absence of menstrual periods in a woman who was previously menstruating. The causes of primary amenorrhea are defects in the ovaries, problems with the reproductive organs, and issues with the pituitary gland, and the central nervous system. Secondary amenorrhea can result from natural causes like pregnancy, and breastfeeding or other causes like low body weight, mental stress, excessive exercise, hormonal imbalance, and birth control pills. A variety of tests are necessary for the diagnosis of amenorrhoea including pregnancy, thyroid function test, ovary function test, male hormone test, and prolactin test. Treatment mainly depends on the cause of amenorrhea. If the cause of amenorrhea is a hormonal imbalance then hormone replacement therapy can be administered. If amenorrhea is due to malnutrition, a proper diet plan can cure the patient successfully. In some cases, surgery is required that can treat anatomical causes of amenorrhea.",

It is characterized by a droopy appearance of the face wherein the patient finds it difficult to move their mouth, raise their forehead and close their eye. The weakness may also affect saliva and tear production as well as the sense of taste.Bell's palsy usually affects only one side of the face; however, in rare cases, it can affect both sides. People in the age group of 15 to 45 years are usually affected, but the disease may occur at any age. Women and men are equally affected or a slight female predilection is seen. The exact cause of the condition is unknown, but it is usually known to be a reaction that occurs after a viral infection. Symptoms generally start to improve after a few weeks, with the recovery of some or all facial functions within six months. However, a prompt visit to the doctor and early treatment leads to a better outlook. It is also essential to rule out life-threatening conditions like stroke.

It is a benign (non-cancerous) condition in which the prostate (a walnut-sized gland) enlarges in size. The prostate gland surrounds the urethra, a tube that carries urine and semen outside of the body. When the prostate gland enlarges, it can make the passage of urine and semen through the urethra a difficult process.  This causes symptoms such as blocking urine outflow, frequent urge to urinate, difficulty in starting urination, dribbling at the end of urine flow, urinary tract infection etc. In India, benign prostatic hyperplasia is a common elderly problem with an incidence rate of 92.97% and 93.3%. AUA guidelines suggested that BPH incidence worldwide will increase, and by the age of 60 years, more than 50% of men would have some evidence of the disease. There are several treatment options available for benign prostate hyperplasia. If you have been diagnosed with the condition, you might be prescribed medications such as finasteride and dutasteride. These medications have proven to be effective in treating BPH. Depending on your condition, your doctor may also advise different types of surgeries that can be used to remove the prostate tissue that is blocking the urinary flow.",

Restrict foods such as processed and packaged foods, milk and meat products.Maintaining optimal fluid intake along with restricting intake of alcohol and caffeine in the form of coffee and soft drinks can also help in preventing constipation. Exercise regularly, do not delay the urge to pass stools and try to manage your stress levels.Along with these changes, treatment of constipation involves many home remedies and use of over the counter laxatives. If relief from constipation is still not achieved, or in case of problems like pain while passing stools or rectal bleeding, it is always better to consult a doctor as long term use of laxatives or chronic constipation can lead to several other complications.",

This in turn leads to flakes with itchy scalp and also causes the hair to shed at a faster than normal rate.Dandruff is seen to mostly occur between puberty to middle-age as this is the phase when the sebaceous glands are most active. The severity of dandruff may fluctuate with the season but it usually worsens during winter. If left untreated, it can cause fungal infections of the skin & may also lead to severe hair fall.

The word atopic in atopic dermatitis indicates an association with allergies. Though the condition is not always directly caused by an allergic reaction, it is commonly associated with other allergic conditions like asthma and hay fever. The condition begins as lesions that are intensely red, bumpy patches or plaques that may ooze fluid when scratched. In chronic eczema, scratching and rubbing create skin lesions that appear scaly, dry, thicker, darker and scarred. While eczema is not contagious, the secondary skin infections associated with the condition may be. Eczema can be lifelong and patients often cycle through long periods of symptom-free remission, followed by brief flare-ups that can be severe. However, symptoms can be prevented and managed with home care and remedies by keeping the skin healthy and moisturized. Exacerbation of eczema requires treatment in the form of corticosteroid creams. In addition to topical treatment, severe acute or chronic eczema often requires systemic immunosuppressant drugs or phototherapy.",

Consumption of contaminated food and beverages can also be a source of infection of gastroenteritis.Most cases of gastroenteritis can be prevented by basic hand hygiene measures, prompt disinfection of contaminated surfaces, and avoiding contaminated food and water.Gastroenteritis caused by rotavirus can be prevented by vaccination of children during their first year of life.Gastroenteritis can be usually treated at home by maintaining the fluid and electrolyte balance by regular intake of clean boiled water, oral rehydration solution (ORS), coconut water, clear soups and fresh fruit juices.In cases of severe dehydration, hospital admission might be required.

It is a condition in which there is a relative increase in intraocular pressure (pressure inside the eyes) which can lead to irreversible loss of vision.Glaucoma is the second most common cause of loss of vision worldwide after cataract with more than 70 million people affected worldwide.Glaucoma can occur at any age but is more common among people above 60 years of age. Several risk factors can increase the risk of glaucoma which include old age, family history of glaucoma, and history of eye injury. Other causes are poor blood flow to the optic nerve and conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes.Glaucoma is a silent thief of vision. In the early stages of glaucoma, there are no symptoms. In reality, most of those who have glaucoma are completely unaware of their condition. Hence regular eye checkups by an ophthalmologist play an important role in managing the disease at an early stage. Treatment protocols include medications and surgical procedures.",

In reality, heart failure is a condition in which the heart fails to pump blood to the body as efficiently as it should.To put it technically, heart failure is a complex condition that impairs the ability of the lower chambers of the heart (called ventricles) to eject blood due to an underlying structural or functional heart problem. The condition develops over time as the heart muscles become weaker or stiffer, which ultimately affects the pumping capacity of the heart. While the risk of suffering from heart failure increases with age, there are certain factors that can put you at risk even at a young age. These include having a high BMI (body mass index), unhealthy choices such as smoking, sedentary lifestyle, consuming a diet high in saturated and trans fats as well as diseases that damage your heart.There are various treatment options that can help in heart failure and many people with heart failure live active lives. Medications for heart failure aim to manage the symptoms, improve the quality of life as well as increase the lifespan.

The occurrence of influenza is worldwide showing pandemic, epidemic, or seasonal patterns. Epidemics of flu happen annually during autumn and winter in temperate areas and produce significant mortality and morbidity each year. The virus is transmitted from person to person with respiratory droplets produced when the patient coughs or sneezes within close contact (<1 m). Individuals usually recover after a few days, but influenza can give rise to complications, especially in high-risk groups like pregnant women, individuals with an underlying immunodeficiency state, adults older than 65 years of age, children below 5 years, and individuals with chronic diseases like asthma, heart and kidney conditions.The symptoms of flu include high fever, body ache, headache, severe malaise, dry cough, sore throat, and runny nose. It should be differentiated from the common cold by clinical presentations. Flu also shares some of its symptoms with COVID -19 infection. One cannot tell the difference between flu and COVID-19 just by looking at the symptoms, hence, testing is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Testing is also important as it can determine if someone is suffering from both flu and COVID-19 at the same time.

This can lead to symptoms such as pale or yellow skin, shortness of breath, chest pain, rapid heartbeat, unexplained weakness, and brittle nails or hair loss. Iron deficiency anemia is very common, especially among women, which include menstruating women, pregnant women and breastfeeding women. It is also quite common in people who have undergone major surgery or physical trauma, people with peptic ulcer disease, vegetarians and not eating a diet rich in iron.The condition is diagnosed by blood tests that include complete blood tests (CBC), low hemoglobin (Hg) and hematocrit (Hct), low ferritin, low serum iron, and low iron saturation. Iron deficiency can be treated by taking medicinal iron in the form of multivitamins until the deficiency is corrected. In severe cases of iron deficiency anemia, red blood cell transfusions may be given that are actively bleeding or have symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or weakness.

      "description": "Jaundice is a condition characterized by yellowish discoloration of the skin, sclera (whites of the eyes), and mucous membranes resulting from the accumulation of excessive amounts of bilirubin. Bilirubin is a waste product that is made during the normal breakdown of hemoglobin. It passes through the liver and is eventually excreted from the body. Excessive bilirubin is the result of increased production or impaired excretion. The normal serum levels of bilirubin are less than 1mg/dl; however, peripheral yellowing of the eye sclera (also known as icterus), is seen when the bilirubin levels are as high as 3 mg/dl as sclerae have a high affinity for bilirubin due to their high elastin content. As the serum bilirubin levels increase, the skin will progressively discolor ranging from yellow to green. The green color is due to biliverdin, a type of bile pigment that gives the color.Jaundice usually does not require treatment in adults. Treatment if required is mostly focussed on its underlying causes and complications. Jaundice can generally be managed with diet or lifestyle, but if the cause is severe, the individuals may need immediate surgical or long-term treatment.",

      "description": "Joint pain is a perception of pain or discomfort in the joints. While pain in the joints is a common occurrence with age, other factors like weight, previous injuries, overuse and underlying systemic medical conditions can also cause it. Joint pain is mostly associated with major joints like knee, hip, ankle or wrist but involvement of small joints is also seen in case of systemic disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis etc. Of the various types of joint pain, osteoarthritis is the most commonly seen joint problem. It is estimated that 9.6% of men and 18% of women above 60 years of age have symptomatic osteoarthritis. This condition is associated with degenerative changes of the joint and most commonly affects the knees, hips, spine and hands. To know the exact cause of the joint pain, your doctor may advise various radiological and laboratory tests. In most cases, joint pain is treated with medications such as painkillers to provide symptomatic relief or with medications that treat the underlying cause of pain. In a few cases, surgery is also recommended. Other therapies such as exercise, yoga, and physiotherapy are also known to be useful in reducing joint pain.",

      "description": "Keratitis is the inflammation of the cornea which is the clear outer layer of the eye that focuses light. The severity of keratitis may range from mild to severe and can be associated with inflammation of other regions of the eye as well. It may also involve one eye (unilateral) or both eyes (bilateral).Keratitis is caused by either infectious agents or non-infectious causes. Infectious diseases are mainly caused by microbes like bacteria, fungi, viruses, and parasites. The noninfectious keratitis is majorly caused by local factors irritating the eye, or other systemic diseases affecting the eye. Some of the common symptoms of keratitis are eye irritation and pain, eye discharge, sensitivity to light, blurred vision or partial blindness, and red eyes.Keratitis is typically easy to treat and resolves quickly. However, if the infection spreads beyond the surface of your cornea, it may leave scars that impair your eyesight or possibly cause loss of vision. Thus, appropriate and timely management is very important. ",
